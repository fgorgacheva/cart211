                    It is easy to believe that shelters are the answer; that if you no longer need a pet you can just
                    leave them at the nearest shelter where they will take care of the animal until someone else will 
                    just adopt them. Realistically, it is unfortunately not that way. Many shelters require financial
                    and human resources to function, they cannot afford to have a large number of animals. When there 
                    are too many animals in a shelter, most often, they begin to euthanise the animals with decreased 
                    chances of adoption; those who've been there longest, the elder animals, those with disabilities, etc.
                    So it is possible that your pet may simply live out the rest of its days in a cold cage, with minimum
                    human contact until it is killed.

                    Of course, unforseen situation that force people to give up their pets are entirely possible. In the 
                    case that a family must do so, it is best to sit down and really do research on which orgnizations
                    work hard to rescue animals from death, shelters that will not kill their animals and that care 
                    to make each animal feel loved until they find a forever home. Looking for a new adoptive family is also 
                    possible, as long as proper research was done and the family is trustworthy and 100% willing to take
                    the animal in.

                    Before adopting or gifting an animal, it is <b>extremely</b> important to evaluate the situation of the person
                    receiving or adopting the animal. Animals require love, care, time and money. They will need to be cleaned after,
                    they will need to be fed, they will need to be vaccinated, their nails will need to be trimmed dogs will need 
                    their coats will need to be brushed, they will need to be trained, dogs will need to be walked and cats' litters
                    will need to be cleaned. They will want to play and they will want to be cuddled. But above all, they will love you
                    like their lives depend on it because they do. Going from a warm house with a family to a cold shelter with nobody
                    is shocking and they won't ever even be able to understand why.

                    So please make sure that you meet the requirements if you are adopting an animal or that the person you want to gift an animal 
                    to is ready and willing to be taking care of a little cat or a dog for the following several years.
