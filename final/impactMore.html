                    In modern days, it is far more common in first world countries to accept that animals must be treated well and can even 
                    be equivalent to a family member. In our society, if we hear of animal cruelty, our hearts ache and we feel the urge to help 
                    animals or to stop their pain. At the very least, we feel disgust and anger towards those who mistreat animals. Unfortunately, 
                    even today, there are still people who think of pets as disposable accessories.

                    In Canada alone, there are an estimated 3000 dogs dumped each year in parks, on the side of the road, or even in dumpsters 
                    (Scott-Reid). It is difficult to estimate just how many animals are dumped every year. The number of abandoned cats must be 
                    even greater, as many believe that cats will be fine if left outside in the wild. Many abandoned pets make the news headlines 
                    if they are truly horrific like the one of a puppy found duct taped on the inside of a box in a dumpster, it is difficult to 
                    tell just how many out there aren’t newsworthy (Scott-Reid) or even found at all.

                    Dogs and cats feel many emotions just the same way that we do. Studies have shown that they experience and display the 6 basic 
                    emotions that we do: happiness, anger, sadness, fear, surprise and disgust. Many have also shown more complex social emotions 
                    like shame, jealousy, guilt and disappointment (Coren) and even longing (Campbell). When abandoned, pets will experience all 
                    kinds of emotions; they will be confused as to why they are left behind, they will feel sad and lonely, longing for the only 
                    family they’ve ever known (Campbell). When a domesticated house pet is abandoned, their worlds shatter. Everything they’ve ever 
                    known disappears. They are left betrayed and lost.

                    Too many people still adopt animals because they think they are cute without considering the evident reality that animals require 
                    time, care and money. As a result, once the animal grows and begins to take more space, to create messes, to eat more food, to 
                    require medical expanses, when people realize they must clean after the animal and they must take the time to train them, they 
                    realize that they do not have the time, will, or money to spare for a "troublesome" animal. So, they take them somewhere and 
                    assume all animals can survive in the wild because they are animals and they will figure it out.

                    In reality, domesticated animals have been with people for far too long to be left to their own devices, especially dogs. Cats 
                    and dogs have been bred and have evolved to be house pets. Dogs have nearly lost their native instinct to hunt for food, even 
                    more so when they get separated from their mothers at a very young age the only thing they've had to do to get food was to somehow 
                    get a person's attention to have their bowls filled. House pets require care. People don't realize that by abandoning cats and dogs, 
                    they put them at risk of severe health problems and even death. Many will starve, many will freeze, many will get mange and parasites 
                    will invade their bodies. They might get hit by a car or get in unimaginable accidents. Many of them will develop trauma from 
                    being abandoned, and wallow in their sadness. Dogs have been documented to let themselves die when too depressed. These are 
                    things that far too many people are unaware of.
