          Here are a few examples of some of my digital artwork. They were all created in Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 using a Wacom Cintiq 16 graphic tablet.

              <p class="text">
                This is definitely one of my favorite pieces and one I am most proud of. I made this one in order to practice proper texture as well as human anatomy. I am usually better in other areas, but I also very much enjoy drawing people because it can share feelings and evoke emotions in a different way that other things can't. So, I wanted to get better at it to be able to make my emotions into art and successfully share them. I am very happy with the way this turned out!

              <h2>Melancholy</h2>
              <p class="text">
                I had a dream about this one. I remember dreaming about a  character I'd seen somewhere and the feeling was quite sad and melancholic. When I woke up, the emotions I had felt in my dream lingered and so did some of the images, so I just started drawing what I could remember and what I could feel. It was also very good practice for textures!

              <h2>Practice</h2>
              <p class="text">
                This small piece was created as part of an exercise from a digital drawing course I took over the summer. It is not an art style I am used to, and drawing anatomically correct body parts as well as correct lighting, shading and coloring to make pieces really come to life were new to me. Thankfully, I was able to transfer the knowledge I had from drawing different kinds of illustrations so this turned out well above my expectations!

              <h2>Practice</h2>
              <p class="text">
                This second small piece was also done as part of the same course mention above. They taught how to use various brushes, tools and textures to bring life to illustrations such as a simple tree. Shading, proper texture and colors can very dramatically change the look and feel of a drawing and after a few tries, I think this small practice piece also ended up look quite nice!
